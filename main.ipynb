With his chiseled physique and piercing eyes, he was often referred to as the \"Absolute Chad\" by his admirers.\n",

Aman took the form of a mighty dragon with scales as blue as the sky and flames that burned with an otherworldly intensity.

    "\n",

    "Undeterred, Sourav swiftly dodged the scorching blue flames, his agility and reflexes unparalleled. With his sword drawn, he lunged towards the dragon, striking with precision and strength. The clash between the Absolute Chad and the Demon of heaven shook the celestial realms, a battle of epic proportions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aman, with his immense power, fought back fiercely. He unleashed gusts of wind and torrents of fire, but Sourav's determination never wavered. He skillfully maneuvered through the chaos, evading every attack. With each strike of his sword, Sourav chipped away at the dragon's defenses.\n",

    "The battle raged on, and it seemed as though victory might elude Sourav. But in a moment of sheer willpower, he tapped into a hidden reserve of strength. His muscles bulged, and an indomitable aura surrounded him. With an earth-shattering roar, Sourav delivered a final, devastating blow to Aman, piercing through the dragon's heart.\n",
